# Task Two
Understanding relational data and framing a problem statement

# Task 2: Data Modeling

## Task Overview
What you'll learn
	Develop an understanding of relational data and how to frame a problem statement

What you'll do
	Review a data model diagram provided by the Data Engineering team and create a strategic plan as to how you’ll use this data to answer the problem statement
	Summarize the choices and plan of work in a PowerPoint presentation

## Here is the background information on your task
Your work on the previous task was very helpful to propel this project forward with the client. Based on your recommendations, they want to focus on the following problem statement:

“Can we accurately predict the stock levels of products based on sales data and sensor data on an hourly basis in order to more intelligently procure products from our suppliers?” 

The client has agreed to share more data in the form of sensor data. They use sensors to measure temperature storage facilities where products are stored in the warehouse, and they also use stock levels within the refrigerators and freezers in store. 

It is your task to look at the data model diagram that has been provided by the Data Engineering team and to decide on what data you’re going to use from the data available. In addition, we need you to create a strategic plan as to how you’ll use this data to complete the work to answer the problem statement. 

You can summarize your choices and plan of work in a PowerPoint presentation. This PowerPoint will be sent to the Data Science team leader and the client for a review. Make sure to keep it concise (ideally 1 slide) and business-friendly. 

## Here is your task
Step 1: Data modeling

Look at the data model provided in the additional resources. Look at all the data that is now available from the client and decide what you want to use for the modeling of the problem statement. This should take 10-15 minutes.

Step 2: Strategic planning

Come up with a plan as to how you’ll use this data to solve the problem statement that the client has positioned. This plan will be used to describe to the client how we are planning to complete the remaining work and to build trust with the client as a domain expert. If you need some guidance, use the provided resource video that describes the high-level overview of a data science project. This should take 10-15 minutes.

Step 3: Communication

Summarize the data that you want to make use of and the strategic plan of action in a single PowerPoint slide. This will be sent to the Data Science team leader and the client, so be sure to be concise and use business-friendly language. This should take 10-15 minutes. 

Estimated time for task completion: 30-45 minutes, depending on your learning style.
