# Task Four
Developing machine learning algorithms for production

# Task 4: Machine Learning Production

## Task Overview
What you'll learn
	Best practices for good quality code, including how to structure and handover a Python module
	How to develop machine learning algorithms for production

What you'll do
	Prepare a Python module that contains code to train a model and output the performance metrics for the Machine Learning engineering team

## Here is the background information on your task
Gala Groceries saw the results of the machine learning model as promising and believe that with more data and time, it can add real value to the business.

To build the foundation for this machine learning use case, they want to implement a first version of the algorithm into production. In the current state, as a Python notebook, this is not suitable to productionize a machine learning model. 

Therefore, as the Data Scientist that created this algorithm, it is your job to prepare a Python module that contains code to train a model and output the performance metrics when the file is run. 

Move on to the next step to get started.

## Here is your task
Additional information about Python modules and running Python files is provided in the additional resources. You can assume for this task that the Python file does not need to process, clean or transform the dataset. The Python file should be able to load a CSV file into a data frame, then immediately start training on that data. Assume that the CSV file will contain the same columns as the dataset that you trained the model on in the previous task.

Be sure to write good quality code, this means following best practices and writing your code in a clear and uniform manner. More information about best practices are provided in the additional resources. Furthermore, make sure to document your code with comments, as this will help the ML engineering team to understand what you’ve written.

When you’re done, submit this file for review by the ML engineering team. 

Step 1: Plan

Good quality code should be planned and should follow a uniform and clear structure. Before you start writing the Python module, take some time to think about how you want to structure this file and what needs to be included from your notebook. It is your choice whether you’d rather write it all in 1 block, separate it out into functions, or create a class with methods. Depending on your ability with coding, you may take a different approach. A starter file “module_starter.py” is provided, which gives some hints as to how you may want to structure the file. If you’re a beginner, you may also want to make use of the file named “module_helper.py”, which includes some functions that you may want to make use of. If you do use this helper file, you can simply copy and paste the functions that you would like to use into the module that you’re writing. This should take 5-10 minutes. 

Step 2: Write

After planning the module that you’re going to write, you can start creating your file! Be sure to follow a consistent and clear structure, and use the additional resources for best practices. Also be sure to include plenty of comments and documentation, because the ML engineering team is not the team that wrote this code. Remember, you can assume that the Python file does not need to process, clean or transform the dataset. You can load the Python file as a CSV file directly into a data frame, and then immediately start training on that data. Assume that the CSV file will contain the same columns as the dataset that you trained the model on in the previous task. This should take you 30-40 minutes. 

Estimated time for task completion: 35-50 minutes, depending on your learning style.
